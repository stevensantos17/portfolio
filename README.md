## Portfolio Projects
### Clustering and Decision Trees for Exploratory Data Analysis
[Repository Link](https://github.com/stevensantos17/Clustering_DecisionTrees_EDA)
- Developed a process to use KMeans Clustering to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset in order to understand and group data
- Decision Trees can be used to interpet the KMeans Clustering output in order to understand how to data was separated and grouped
- Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to visualize results to users
