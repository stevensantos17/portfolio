# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

## Portfolio Projects

### Customer Churn Analysis & Predictive Modelling
[Repository Link](https://github.com/stevensantos17/Customer_Churn_Project)
- Analyzed Data and Extracted Insights on what characteristics led to customer churn and how the company can promote services and increase sales
- Analyzed Business impact of customer churn on company revenue
- Trained and Evaluated a predicitive model to determine which customers will churn in order to implement customer retention efforts and increase revenue
- Topics: Data Visualization, Predictive Modelling, Statistical Analysis, Data Analysis

### Clustering and Decision Trees for Exploratory Data Analysis
[Repository Link](https://github.com/stevensantos17/Clustering_DecisionTrees_EDA)
- Developed a process to use KMeans Clustering to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset in order to understand and group data
- Decision Trees are then used to interpet the KMeans Clustering output in order to understand how to data was separated and grouped
- These trained predictive models can then be used to predict and group new datapoints
- Applications: Exploring and Understanding customer data for the purpose of selling products
- Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to visualize results to users

### Diabetes Classification Project
[Repository Link](https://github.com/stevensantos17/Diabetes_Classification_Project)
- Project to create a Classification model to predict the onset of Diabetes based on diagnostic predictors
- The goal & impact of this classifier is to assist staff in the medical care and diagnosis of patients.
- Classification Models, Feature Engineering, and Data Analysis & Visualization were used
